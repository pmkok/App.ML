Abstract: Solar flares are sudden bursts of energy that occur on the sun’s surface, resulting in the release of high-energy particles and electromagnetic radiation. 
Solar flares can be seen as a big threat to humanity. They can cause disruptions in communication and navigation systems on Earth, as well as pose a risk to astronauts in space.
Therefore, predicting the occurrence and intensity of solar flares is an important problem in space weather forecasting. 
In this project, we are trying to use machine learning techniques to analyze the Solar Flare Data Set by Gary Bradshaw and develop a model that can predict the occurrence and intensity of solar flares.
